#### Types of AI:
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI):**
   - Performs specific tasks.
   - Limited capabilities.

2. **General AI (Strong AI):**
   - Mimics human intelligence.
   - Can perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. (Largely theoretical as of now)

#### Key AI Techniques:
1. **Machine Learning (ML):**
   - Trains models on data.
   - Makes predictions or decisions.

2. **Deep Learning:**
   - Subset of ML.
   - Involves neural networks with many layers.
   - Handles large amounts of data.
